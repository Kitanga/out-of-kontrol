# Out Of Kontrol - Phaser Plugin
The plugin that's actually in control of your game's controls.

(Made with love from Africa. Now, whether you buy or not, have a good day! Continueing)

You can buy it from me on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/OutofKontrolPhaserPlugin). If that doesn't convince you, maybe this will...

## What is this?

Out of Kontrol (OoK) is a key/input mapper. In other words, it allows you to have different input methods do the same thing.

Want the WASD keys, arrow keys, and your custom placed buttons to control movement, then OoK is for you. Want to easily allow users to change the controls that you spent hours setting and testing, then OoK is for you!!

## Included:

- Minified version of Out of Kontrol.
- Phaser 2.6.2 + Out of Kontrol (minified)
- No source code :'(
- Manual
- A Basic example of all the functions found in OoK in action
- Developer love lol. No seriously, under all that minified and unobfuscated code is a lot of love from a dev to a dev.
